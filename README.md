## ConvNets Feature Maps 
Full ConvNets Feature map representation and video rendering.


## Introduction
This project uses Python and OpenCV to display feature maps of a ConvNet trained for an mini RC autonomous car and render a video with the obtained activations. The full article is avaliable on [Medium](https://keras.io).
